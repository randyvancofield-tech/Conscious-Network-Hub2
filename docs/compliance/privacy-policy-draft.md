# Privacy Policy Draft - Conscious Network Hub

**Effective Date:** January 1, 2026  
**Last Updated:** January 19, 2026  

This Privacy Policy outlines how Conscious Network Hub ("we," "us," or "our") collects, uses, discloses, and safeguards your information when you use our decentralized social learning platform. This policy is designed to comply with global privacy frameworks, including the EU General Data Protection Regulation (GDPR, Regulation (EU) 2016/679), California Consumer Privacy Act (CCPA) as amended by the California Privacy Rights Act (CPRA), India's Digital Personal Data Protection Act (DPDP Act, 2023), China's Personal Information Protection Law (PIPL, effective November 1, 2021), Brazil's Lei Geral de Proteção de Dados (LGPD, in force since September 18, 2020), and Vietnam's Personal Data Protection Decree (effective January 1, 2026). As of January 1, 2026, comprehensive privacy laws are also effective in Indiana, Kentucky, and Rhode Island, which we acknowledge and incorporate herein.

## 2. How We Use Your Information

- **Service Provision:** To deliver decentralized learning experiences, community connections, and AI-assisted guidance.
- **Personalization:** To tailor content, pathways, and interactions based on user preferences.
- **Security:** To protect against unauthorized access and ensure platform integrity.
- **Compliance:** To meet legal obligations under applicable privacy laws.
- **Research and Improvement:** To analyze usage patterns and improve our services (anonymized where possible).

## 3. Information Sharing and Disclosure

We do not sell personal information. Disclosures are limited to:
- **Service Providers:** Third-party vendors who assist in operations, bound by data processing agreements.
- **Legal Requirements:** When required by law or to protect rights and safety.
- **User Consent:** With explicit permission for specific purposes.
- **Blockchain Storage:** Certain data hashes are stored on immutable blockchain ledgers for provenance and transparency.

## 4. Blockchain and Data Immutability

We acknowledge the tension between blockchain technology's immutability and the "right to erasure" under laws like GDPR and CCPA. Our approach:
- **Off-Chain Storage:** Personal identifiable information (PII) is stored off-chain in encrypted, erasable databases.
- **On-Chain Hashes:** Only cryptographic hashes of data are stored on-chain for verification and provenance.
- **Erasure Process:** Upon request, we delete PII from our systems and mark associated hashes as invalidated, though blockchain immutability means historical hashes remain.
- **Data Provenance:** Blockchain ensures data integrity and prevents unauthorized alterations.

## 5. AI Transparency and Rights

Our AI systems, including the Wisdom Node, are designed with transparency and user rights in mind:
- **Explainability:** Users can request explanations for AI-generated recommendations or decisions.
- **Bias Mitigation:** We employ techniques to reduce bias in AI outputs, including diverse training data and regular audits.
- **User Rights:** You have the right to opt-out of AI personalization, correct inaccurate AI-derived data, and request human review of automated decisions.
- **Data Minimization:** AI processing is limited to necessary data for service delivery.

## 6. Cross-Border Data Transfers

Data may be transferred internationally for service provision. We ensure:
- **Adequacy Decisions:** Transfers to countries with adequate protection (e.g., EU-US Data Privacy Framework where applicable).
- **Standard Contractual Clauses:** Used for transfers to non-adequate countries.
- **Consent and Transparency:** Clear notices and consent for international transfers.

## 7. Your Rights

Depending on your jurisdiction, you may have the following rights:
- **Access:** Request a copy of your personal data.
- **Rectification:** Correct inaccurate or incomplete data.
- **Erasure:** Request deletion of your data (subject to blockchain limitations).
- **Portability:** Receive your data in a structured format.
- **Restriction:** Limit processing in certain circumstances.
- **Objection:** Object to processing based on legitimate interests.
- **Withdraw Consent:** Revoke consent for processing based on consent.
